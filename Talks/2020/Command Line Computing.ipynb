    "## Creating Scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "Scripts are simply text files that contain instructions that can be understood or executed by an internal command or interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we can create a simple `zsh` script as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "#! /bin/zsh\n",
    "<instruction line 1>\n",
    "<instruction line 2>\n",
    "```\n",
    "e.g.\n",
    "```\n",
    "#! /bin/zsh\n",
    "ls | echo \"This contents of this folder are:\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "This file, when executed, will print \"The contents of this folder are:\" followed by a listing of the files and folders in the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* Although the shebang (`#!`) is not strictly required, it tells the operating system it is an exectable and how to execute it. There are many reasons to use it. For further reading, see the [Wikipedia Shebang article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)).\n",

    "## Invoking Scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main ways to execute scripts.\n",
    "* manually invoke the script by passing them as arguments to a command e.g. `sh scipt.sh` or `python main.py`.\n",
    "* by marking the script as executable and invoking it directly e.g.\n",
    "```\n",
    "chmod +x script.sh\n",
    "./script.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* when using the second approch, notice that we specify the current folder for the scripts location, otherwise the OS will typically only look in the systems PATH. This is deliberate and for security reasons. Without this behavior, locally placed files could maliciously intercept commands and alter the desired behavior.\n"

    "## Symlinks - \"With great power....\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Symlinks are symbolic links. They appear as file system objects but are effectively just pointers to other files and folders. They are useful for accessing the same file from various places or paths. Instead of making \"copies\", a symlink just \"points\" to the original file and *makes it appear like it is in multiple places!*\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ln -s <file/folder> <linkname>` - create a symbolic to the `<file/folder>` called `<linkname>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Warning:* Symbolic links are very powerful in terms of linking, sharing and preventing data duplication, but they also make it very easy to delete and modify data unintentionally. Beware.\n"

    "\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* `alias <name>='<commands>'` - Give the series of `<commands>` the alias `<name>`.\n",
