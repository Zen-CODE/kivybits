# Kivy Complete VM - 0.7

## Intro

Greetings. This VM is intended to provide a complete Kivy launch and development
environment. It is not intended to be lightweight and minimal, but complete and
flexible.

This document outlines the configuration and use of the VM, so that you can use
and manage the machine optimally.

Download [Kivy_Complete_VM_0.7](http://kivy.braintrainerplus.com/latest.ova)

md5 checksum: 68a062c935afd88df9c9ddbe9e28a700

Please consult the ReadMe.txt on the VM's desktop for more information.

## Checkouts

The VM is configured for Python 3.6 support. The build/checkout versions of the
packages are as follows:

* Kivy version - 1.11.1
* Ubuntu 18.04.03
* buildozer - latest (as of 2019/12/12)
* Python-for-android - latest (as on 2019/12/12)
* Android NDK - 17c
* Android SDK - 28

 These are checked out in the ~/Repos folder. Kivy is built in these folders,
 using the symlinks below.

  /usr/local/lib/python3.6/distpackages/kivy -> /home/kivy/Repos/kivy/kivy

This means that in order to build and run a new/old version, you can simply
checkout the tag (or master for latest) you wish to use, recompile and it's
ready to use.

## Buildozer projects

The VM contains two sample buildozer spec files that successfully build the
touchtracer APK. These lie here:

    Python3: /home/kivy/Repos/kivy/examples/demo/touchtracer/

Please see the buildozer.spec files in these folder for the appropriate
settings.

The VM comes pre-installed with for:

    android.sdk = 28

    android.api = 19 or android.api = 27

Other versions can be specified, but might result in the downloading and
installation of these packages.

## Android SDK

The VM comes with SDK 28 pre-installed. To update or reconfigure it:

    cd /home/kivy/Android/android-sdk-28/tools/
    ./android

## Android Debugging with buildozer

Please note that in order to attached devices to the VM for debugging,
you first need to give permissions. Un linux hosts, this means running

    sudo adduser $USER vboxusers

where user is your identity in the host machine. You should then be able
attach a USB filter that allows the VM to pick up your devices.

In order to start the adb server:

    cd /home/kivy/Android/android-sdk-28/platform-tools/
    sudo ./adb start-server
    sudo ./adb start-server
    ./adb devices

Your devices should be listed with the last command. You can then launch
your app with debug output (when inside you app folder) via

    buildozer android debug deploy run logcat
